# Launch Stack

## (Optional 1) Launch Stack for Global Regions

### Launch Main Stack
1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and use the button below to launch the `log-hub` AWS CloudFormation template.
    
    [![Launch Stack](../../images/launch-stack.png)](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home#/stacks/create/template?stackName=LogHub&templateURL=https://{{ bucket }}.s3.amazonaws.com/log-hub/{{ version }}/LogHub.template){target=_blank}

3. The template launches in the US East (N. Virginia) Region by default. To launch the solution in a different AWS Region, use the Region selector in the console navigation bar.

4. On the **Create stack** page, verify that the correct template URL shows in the **Amazon S3 URL** text box and choose **Next**.

5. On the **Specify stack details** page, assign a name to your solution stack. For information about naming character limitations, refer to [IAM and STS Limits](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_iam-limits.html) in the *AWS Identity and Access Management User Guide*.

6. Under **Parameters**, review the parameters for the template and modify them as necessary. This solution uses the following default values.

    | Parameter  | Default          | Description                                                  |
    | ---------- | ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
    | Admin User Email | `<Requires input>` | Specify the email of the Administrator to receive an auto-generated password. You need to use the email and password to log in to the Log Hub console. You can create more users directly in the provisioned Cognito User Pool after launching the solution. |

7. Choose **Next**.

8. On the **Configure stack options** page, choose **Next**.

9. On the **Review** page, review and confirm the settings. Check the box acknowledging that the template creates AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) resources.

10. Choose **Create** stack to deploy the stack.

You can view the status of the stack in the AWS CloudFormation console in the **Status** column. You should receive
a **CREATE_COMPLETE** status in approximately 15 minutes.

This solution generates a CloudFront domain name that gives you access to the Log Hub console. The domain name can be found
in the **Outputs** tab of the CloudFormation template as an **WebConsoleUrl**. 

After successful deployment, an email containing the temporary login password is sent to the provided email address. 

Use the following procedure to log in to the web console.

1. Open the **WebConsoleUrl** using a web browser, then navigate to a sign-in page.
2. Sign in with the **AdminEmail** and the temporary password.

    a. Set a new account password.

    b. (Optional) Verify your email address for account recovery.

3. After the verification is complete, the system opens the web console.

Once you have logged into the Log Hub console, you can [import an AOS domain](./domains/import.md#import-opensearch-domain) and [create log analytics pipelines](pipelines/index.md).
