This chapter describes how to manage Amazon OpenSearch Service (AOS) domains on the Log Hub console. An AOS domain is synonymous with an AOS cluster.

In this chapter, you will learn: 

* [Import & remove an AOS Domain](./import.md)
* [Create an access proxy](./proxy.md)
* [Create recommended alarms](./alarms.md)

You can read the [Getting Started](./../getting-started/index.md) chapter first and walk through the basic steps for using the Log Hub solution.
