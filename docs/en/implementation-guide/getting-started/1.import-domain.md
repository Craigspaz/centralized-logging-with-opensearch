# Step 1: Import an Amazon OpenSearch domain

To use the Log Hub solution for the first time, you must import AOS domains first.

Log Hub supports Amazon OpenSearch domain with [fine-grained access control](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/opensearch-service/latest/developerguide/fgac.html) enabled [within a VPC](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/opensearch-service/latest/developerguide/vpc.html) only.

    Currently, Log Hub supports Amazon Elasticsearch 7.10 and later, or Amazon OpenSearch 1.0 and later.

## Prerequisite

At least one AOS domain within VPC. If you don't have an AOS domain yet, you can create an AOS domain within VPC. See [Launching your Amazon OpenSearch Service domains within a VPC][vpc]. 

## Steps
Use the following procedure to import an AOS domain on the Log Hub console.

1. Sign in to the Log Hub console.
2. In the navigation pane, under **Domains**, choose **Import OpenSearch Domain**. 
3. On the **Step 1. Select domain** page, choose a domain from the dropdown list. 
4. Choose **Next**.
5. On the **Step 2. Configure network** page, under **Network creation**, choose **Automatic**. If your Log Hub and OpenSearch domains resides in two different VPCs, the *Automatic* mode will create a VPC Peering Connection between them, and update route tables. See details in [Set up VPC Peering](../domains/import.md#set-up-vpc-peering). 
6. On the **Step 3. Create tags** page, choose **Import**.
