A Log Pipeline includes the process of receiving, cleaning, enhancing, and writing data to AOS. Typically, a log pipeline only accepts logs in one format.
A log analytics pipeline corresponds to an index pattern in AOS (e.g. `log-hub-nginx-log-index`)ã€‚

## FAQ

Q. Why not use Firehose to collect and write to AOS?

Because the minimum buffer interval of Firehose is 60s, it is difficult to meet the scene of real-time class analysis. Please refer to [Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose Quota](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/firehose/latest/dev/limits.html).
